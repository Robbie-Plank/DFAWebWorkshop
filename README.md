# Environment Setup Guide

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/uiuc-web-programming/mp1_starter.git mp1, then cd mp1
2. Install dependencies: npm install or npm i
3. Run the dev server: npm run dev
4. Open a browser and go to http://localhost:8080/ to view your page. You should see "Welcome to MP1!" at the top of the screen. Note that if for some reason your port 8080 is occupied, it will default to 8081.
